# Rock-Paper-Scissor-Cellular-Automaton

Creates a grid of cells where each cell state beats or is beaten by some other cell states.
Each cell counts the number of "predator" neighbours and if this number is higher than a threshold it becomes one of the predator cells.
Also shows a live Histogram of the color distribution.

Example: Black beats yellow, red beats black, yellow beats red (https://redd.it/9sgfqe)
